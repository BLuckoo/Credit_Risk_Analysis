Evaluating Credit Risk using resampling models

## Overview of the Loan Prediction Analysis

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. 

This project employs different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. The ***"imbalanced-learn"*** and ***"scikit-learn"*** libraries will be used to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, the data will be oversampled using the ***"RandomOverSampler"*** and ***"SMOTE"*** algorithms, and undersampled using the ***"ClusterCentroids"*** algorithm. A combination approach of over- and undersampling using the ***"SMOTEENN"*** algorithm will also be used.

For comparison, two new machine learning models that reduce bias, ***"BalancedRandomForestClassifier"*** and ***"EasyEnsembleClassifier"***, will be used to predict credit risk.
